<h1>🍔 Grillpop — A tasty little fast food project!</h1>

<p>This is a fun and colorful website for a fictional fast food spot called Grillpop. You’ll find burgers, pizzas, Asian dishes, and desserts all wrapped up in a fast and friendly design. It’s all about good vibes, tasty visuals, and smooth user experience. Just a small project I cooked up to practice frontend skills and have some fun with food-themed design!</p>
